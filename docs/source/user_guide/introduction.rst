Introduction
============

Espresso is a community driven project to create a large suite of forward simulations 
to enable researchers to get example problems without the need to understand each 
individual forward problem in detail.

Espresso's simple and consistent code structure enables users to access a wide range
of different forward code and contributors to share their solutions with a wider
audience. Having the basic set up and several examples in
place already, we hope to encourage more examples be developed and be contributed.
