Welcome to the documentation of Espresso!
=========================================

Espresso is a collection of clearly defined forward codes
that simulate physical processes from many disciplines within the geosciences
and elsewhere. The goal of Espresso is to 
bring together people developing physical simulations with those who need them.

.. Espresso's simple and consistent code structure enables users to access a wide range
.. of different forward code and contributors to share their solutions with a wider
.. audience. Having the basic set up and several examples in
.. place already, we hope to encourage more examples be developed and be contributed.

This project is led by `InLab <http://www.inlab.edu.au/>`_.
